# Spring Boot User Login and Registration
I am following along with a Java Spring Boot 
[tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwQuro7ekvc&t=164s).

NOTE: when Implementing the Security, I had to do things differently due to 
using a different version of Spring Security. The following links are references
to any documentation that helped me in doing so.
